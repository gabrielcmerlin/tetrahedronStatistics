# Tetrahedron in a Sphere

The group formed by Artur De Vlieger Lima [13671574], Gabriel da Costa Merlin [12544420] and
Vicenzo Dâ€™Arezzo Zilio [13671790], through simulations, studied the probability of the center of
a sphere will be contained in a tetrahedron whose vertex was randomly generated on the surface of that sphere.
This was the work carried out for the Statistics discipline taught by professor Eduardo Fontoura Costa
during the 2nd semester of 2023.
